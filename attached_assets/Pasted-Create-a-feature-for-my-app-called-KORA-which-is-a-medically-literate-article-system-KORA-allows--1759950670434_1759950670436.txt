Create a feature for my app called KORA, which is a medically literate article system.
KORA allows users to search, view, and download medical/scientific articles (with images) in a smooth, interactive way, without using AI.
________________________________________
🧩 Core Logic
1.	When a user searches for an article:
o	The app first checks the local database (BetterSQLite3) for a match.
o	If a match is found → instantly display it.
o	If no match is found → fetch from Semantic Scholar API for scientific data.
o	If no data is found there → fetch from Wikipedia API for summaries + images.
o	Display the fetched article as if it’s being typed live (like GitHub Copilot typing in VS Code). Images fade-in nicely.
o	Articles are temporarily stored in memory only while the user is viewing them.
When a new search happens, the previously viewed article is cleared.
2.	If the user clicks “Download Article”, the following happens:
o	The full article (text + images + metadata) is saved locally in the BetterSQLite3 database.
o	A small “Downloaded” status appears beside that article in search suggestions (like Google’s “visited” links).
o	The article becomes available under a “Downloads” page for offline reading.
o	All data is saved to automatically avoid data loss even when app closes mistakenly.

💾 Downloads Page
•	Shows all downloaded articles stored locally.
•	Each article displays its title, category, date saved, and a preview thumbnail (first image or first few lines).
•	Clicking an article opens it for offline reading (rendering text and images properly).
•	A “Save as PDF” button allows the user to export the article to their PC as a PDF, including images and formatting.
•	Clicking opens the offline reader/editor view.
🧰 3️⃣ Offline Reader & Editor Features
When reading a downloaded article, users can:
✨ Highlight
•	Select text and highlight it in yellow or green.
•	Highlights are saved automatically in the local database.
📑 Bookmark
•	Add one or multiple bookmarks.
•	On reopening, users can choose “Scroll to Bookmark”.
•	Bookmarks are auto-saved.
☁️ Add Thought (Unique Feature)
•	When a user selects a text section and clicks “Add Thought”:
o	A small cartoon-style cloud appears above the selected text.
o	Inside the cloud is a text box where they can type their thought.
o	They can Save or Cancel.
o	The original highlighted section remains highlighted in a distinct color (e.g., light blue).
o	When hovering over that highlight:
	A “View Thought” button appears.
	Clicking it opens the thought in a neat floating box with the text they wrote and a “Close” button.
o	Thoughts can later be edited or deleted.
o	All changes (add, edit, delete) are saved automatically in the local database.
📝 Other Editing Features
•	Underline important terms.
•	Add small sticky notes in the margin (stored per article).
•	Auto-save all user edits (no manual save required).
•	Restore defaults to remove all annotations for an article.
•	Search for a word in the downloaded documents.

PDF generation:
Use jsPDF (frontend) or pdfkit (backend) to convert the article’s HTML/text and images into a PDF and download it.

⚙️ Storage & APIs
Purpose	Tool	Description
Temporary data	In-memory (JS variables / context)	Holds currently viewed article
Persistent local storage	BetterSQLite3	Stores downloaded articles only
Article search	Semantic Scholar API	Fetch structured scientific content
Fallback data	Wikipedia REST API	Fetch summaries + images for general topics
Export	jsPDF or pdfkit	Save downloaded articles as PDF files
________________________________________
💡 Search Suggestions
•	While typing, show live search suggestions (like Google/YouTube style).
•	If a suggestion exists in local downloads, show a small “Downloaded” badge next to it.
•	Clicking a suggestion loads the full article view.

🧠 5️⃣ Search & Display Behavior
•	Search suggestions show both:
o	Online matches (Semantic Scholar + Wikipedia)
o	Local matches (BetterSQLite3)
•	Downloaded articles in suggestions have a small “Downloaded” badge.
•	Clicking them loads from local storage instantly.

📂 6️⃣ Export as PDF
•	Users can export any downloaded article as a PDF with:
o	Highlights
o	Thoughts (as side notes or footnotes)
o	Embedded images
o	Title, subtitle, and formatted text
Generated using jsPDF (frontend) or pdfkit (backend). 
Users are prompted by a pop up to select either with their edits(if they edited the download at all) or without the edits and they comfirm.

🎨 UI Behavior
•	Article appears with proper formatting:
o	Title: bold and large
o	Subtitles: smaller but bold
o	Paragraphs: normal readable text
o	Images: embedded at the correct places
o	Hover effects for highlights and action buttons (View Thought, Add Thought, Delete, etc.)
o	Delete function for downloaded data, and when in a downloaded article then delete function for any edit made and also a cancel button for all edit features to abort edit. 
o	DELETING ALSO DELETES FROM LOCAL STORAGE COMPLETELY! 
•	When fetching online → show live feedback:
“Searching Semantic Scholar…”
“Fetching Wikipedia data…”
“Displaying results…”
•	If no results found → show:
“No results found for this topic.”

🏆 Overall Design Goals
•	No uploads or user-generated spam.
•	Lightweight but powerful.
•	Works offline (for downloaded articles).
•	Feels interactive, modern, and educational.
•	Articles are displayed with text and images, and can be saved as PDFs.
•	The system grows smarter locally, not through AI but through user downloads.

10️⃣ Optional Later Add-ons
-	Randomize button to search for random article about medicine.




FINAL PLAN:
A medical article search and management system with online/offline detection, completion notifications, offline reading, annotation tools, and Electron-compatible architecture
I'll include the following features:
•	Search interface with live suggestions matching the cream/beige and dark teal color scheme from the design
•	Online/offline status indicator with real-time connection monitoring
•	Offline mode handling: prevent online searches and display 'Connect to internet' message when offline
•	Semantic Scholar API integration for scientific articles with fallback to Wikipedia API (online only)
•	Local BetterSQLite3 database for downloaded articles storage
•	Article display with live typing effect and fade-in images
•	Green pulse animation when article loading completes (if user on article page)
•	Toast notification when article loading completes (if user on different page like Downloads)
•	Download functionality to save articles locally with 'Downloaded' badge in search suggestions
•	Downloads page showing all saved articles with thumbnails and metadata
•	Offline reader with highlight feature (yellow/green colors) with auto-save
•	Bookmark functionality with scroll-to-bookmark feature
•	Unique 'Add Thought' feature with cartoon cloud UI and text input
•	Additional editing tools: underline, sticky notes, and in-document search
•	PDF export with jsPDF including all content, images, and user annotations
•	Delete functionality for downloads and individual edits
•	Responsive UI with KORA branding, search bar, and Downloads button (no Upload button)
•	Allow searching downloaded articles even when offline
•	Electron-compatible architecture (localStorage/IndexedDB fallback for BetterSQLite3, relative paths, no hardcoded URLs)
